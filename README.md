## About The Project

> **If you are in the same situation where you have to remember your young child's passwords (as they are not old enough to manage) or a family member that you assisted to setup an account for but from time to time, you are asked: _"Do you remember what my password is?"_**

This is an offline password storage application. The idea of this application is to allow storing of login credentials in an encrypted and secured manner where you can create and manage **multiple profiles** for yourself and your family/team members.
This is an offline only application so as to eliminate the worry of leaks on cloud or servers.
