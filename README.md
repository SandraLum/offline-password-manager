# Offline Password Manager

This is an offline password storage application. The idea of this application is to allow storing of password details in an encrypted and secured manner for each profile you create for your family/team.
This is an offline only application so as to eliminate the worry of leaks in cloud or servers.

Developed using react native and expo, with typescripting. For the UI framework, it is using React Native Paper and tailwind.

Suggestions or comments are welcomed!
